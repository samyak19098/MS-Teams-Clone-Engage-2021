 # Project Description and Features
 
  This is an audio-video calling application that supports peer-to-peer as well as group calling features. The calling has been implemented using WebRTC technology and connections   have been made using sockets. PeerJS is used for the peer to peer communication features. It also has the feature of screensharing using which any participant can share their     full screen, a particular Chrome Tab or a particular application window to the participants present in the meeting. Multiple people can alos share their screen at once. 
  The participants also have custom control choices regarding selecting which user's video stream or shared-screen stream they want to pause/maximize(full-screen) or adjust the     volume of each participant individually. There is also a Room Chat feature using which all the participants can text-chat in the meeting with each other. Whenever a new-message   is received from another participant , there is a notification show to all the other participants on their screens. The chat logs all the meetings message along with their times   and can be accessed at any point of time during the meeting. Participants can also invite other participants to join the meeting/call through the two different invite features.   The first one is that they can copy the meeting code from the meeting info provided by clicking the Info icon and share the code with their friends/colleagues who can then visit   the homepage enter the code and join the meeting. The other feature is inviting through E-Mail, through which they can enter the emails of the people they wish to invite and an   email will be sent from my end(the developer/company's end) which will include the meeting code and a clickable link to directly join the meeting.
  
  There are some other additional features as well. These include a raise hand feature using which, if any participant wants to speak/raise a point they may raise their hands and   all other participants in the call/meeting are notified the same. After speaking their points then the candidate may lower their hand and other participants will be notified       accordingly. There are also features to mute yourself, stop your camera(video). The participants can also check their network connection if facing any issues using the 'Network   Connection' button provided and it will show the Bandwidth, status of the low data mode and the Signal Strength of their internet connection.At all points, the current time is     also visible on the screen of the pariticipants.
