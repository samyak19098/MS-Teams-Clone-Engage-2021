# MS Teams Clone Engage 2021
 This project is my submission for Microsoft Engage Program 2021.
 
  This is an audio-video calling application that supports peer-to-peer as well as group calling features. The calling has been implemented using WebRTC technology and connections   have been made using sockets. PeerJS is used for the peer to peer communication features. It also has the feature of screensharing using which any participant can share their     full screen, a particular Chrome Tab or a particular application window to the participants present in the meeting. Multiple people can alos share their screen at once. 
  The participants also have custom control choices regarding selecting which user's video stream or shared-screen stream they want to pause/maximize(full-screen) or adjust the     volume of each participant individually.
